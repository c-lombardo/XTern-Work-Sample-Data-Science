Included in this repository is the CSV file representing the dataset given, a folder named "out" containing my conclusions, and a python program I wrote to draw these conclusions.

The four different conclusions I drew from the data were:
1. The top 10 trending restaurants
2. The best restaurants from each cuisine
3. The restaurants with the best rating to average cost ratios
4. The restaurants with the greatest variety of cuisine
